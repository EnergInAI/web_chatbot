Solar Sizing & Savings – EnergInAI Knowledge

1. Basic Solar Formula
1 kW solar = 4–4.5 units/day (average)

2. Home requirement
- 1–2 BHK → 2 to 3 kW
- 3–4 BHK → 4 to 6 kW

3. Savings Calculation
Savings = (Units Generated × Cost per Unit) – Maintenance

Example:
4 kW solar → 16 units/day  
Bill rate = ₹8/unit  
Daily savings = ₹128  
Monthly savings ≈ ₹3,800  
Yearly savings ≈ ₹45,600

4. Solar depends on:
- Roof area  
- Bill amount  
- Day vs night load  
- Panel angle  
- Shading

5. Solar Problems:
- Less units → panel shading  
- Low savings → wrong usage pattern  
- Excess load → system undersized
